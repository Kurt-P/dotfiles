Dot Files
=========

These are my person dot file that are found in the $HOME dir. I am putting them
on github so that if at anytime I need to redeploy a system of mine, I don't
need to worry about losing them. 

### weather.sh
This file should be put into `~/.bin/` <br />
It is used by .conkyrc to get the local weather
