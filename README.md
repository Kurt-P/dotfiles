# dotfiles

These are my person dot file that are found in the $HOME dir. I am putting them
on github so that if at anytime I need to redeploy a system of mine, I don't
need to worry about losing them. 

### conkyrc
For conkyrc to work you need to make a folder in your `$HOME/` directory called
`.bin`. After that, copy the contents of `scripts/` into that folder, and 
restart conky.
