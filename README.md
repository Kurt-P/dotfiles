Dot Files
=========

These are my person dot file that are found in the $HOME dir. I am putting them
on github so that if at anytime I need to redeploy a system of mine, I don't
need to worry about losing them. 

Righ now the only two that I have a are bashre and vimrc. I'm not totally sure
if I'll ever have more than that.

I also added my .gitconfig file, but removed my name and email address.
